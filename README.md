# Santander-Customer-Transaction-Prediction
Machine learning study on Santander Bank dataset to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.

Background â€“ Santander's mission is to help people and businesses succeed by providing them with financial products and services to help them achieve their goals. They use data science and machine learning techniques to better understand their customers and identify new solutions to common problems like determining customer satisfaction, predicting product purchases, and assessing loan repayment abilities. They actively collaborate with the global data science community to improve their algorithms in detecting binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?
Therefore; in this study, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.
